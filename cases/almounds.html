    <div class="case">An iOS application that handles and <span style="color: #7df9ff;">optimizes the day to day operations of an actual almond processing plant</span> in Central California.</div>

      <span class="header">The almond processing plant for the Central California Almond Growers Association (CCAGA) <b>spans 200 acres and holds 30 types of almonds represented by 300 growers</b>, yet is organized and represented by <i><b>paper-grid with handwritten text from employees</b></i>.
      </span>
      <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50vw;" src="../images/almounds/paper_grid.png" width="100" />
      <span class="header">This makes the day-to-day operations of the plant very difficult with a lack of organization and efficiency as the paper grid, meant to represent the vast plant and its current almond loads, uses random placement that wastes money and resources for each load to be placed. Therefore, the administration at the almond processing plant is not equipped with the tools to handle the various robust tasks that are required of the plant.
      <br></br>
      <b><span style="color: #964B00;">They need a centralized and modern system in place to handle these day-to-day operations of the processing plant in an efficient and organized manner.</span></b></span>
      
      <i><h3 class="text">"Why do the workers need this new system?"</h3></i>
      <span class="speak">Currently, workers at the processing plant have no way to efficiently place the almond loads being dropped off and typically choose random placement with the hope that it can be placed there under specific requirements on where it can be placed due to the type of almond and the grower. Therefore, these loads consume a lot of time and money required for employees, the land, and the machines at the plant to place these loads on the grid of land to store until further processing. These workers are not equipped to decide efficient dropoff placement for the almond loads, making it difficult to save time, energy, and resources.</span>

      <i><h3 class="text">"How was the application designed?"</h3></i>
      <span class="speak">In order to make design decisions in the best interest of the user, we spoke to employees at the processing plant and revieved a variety of documents they use to clearly understand the issues they face with the current organizational system of the processign plant. From their rfeedback and our own understanding, we found importance in the following points:</span>
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>Users need specific features to be avialable to them as certain types of employees use certain features more or not at all (and shouldn't have the privilege to).</li>
        <li>Users need flexibility regarding administration privileges to override necessary changes of employees and the manipulation of the grid itself (add, deleting, updating stockpile locations).</li>
        <li>Users need to be able to enter information about the almond loads type and grower to be used accordingly to determine where the load should be dropped off on the plant.</li>
        <li>Users need the ability to edit any previous information about loads, grids, or users in an efficient manner.</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="speak">After taking these ideas into consideration when designing the application, we developed the following wireframes of (most of) our application:</span>
      <img style="height: 90vh; object-fit: contain" src="../images/almounds/screens.png"/>
      <br></br>
      <span class="speak">I worked on developing the frontend features of the application. This involved using React Native and Axios to develop all the facial features of the application (buttons, apperance, etc.) and connect the functionality of it accordinly. In doing so and working with my team, we were able to develop and iterate upon the following features and more:</span>
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>A fully functioning login screen with password authentication capability.</li>
        <img style="width: 50vw; height: 50vh; object-fit: contain" src="../images/almounds/login.png"/>
        <li>Accounts that contains user-specific functionality based on the 3 types of employess: Administration, Escorts, and Scalers.</li>
        <img style="width: 50vw; height: 50vh; object-fit: contain" src="../images/almounds/role1.png"/>
        <img style="width: 25vw; height: 50vh; object-fit: contain" src="../images/almounds/role2.png"/>
        <li>Users can edit, add, or delete grids, users, loads, and elevators (transports almonds to stockpile).</li>
        <img style="width: 50vw; height: 50vh; object-fit: contain" src="../images/almounds/load.png"/>
        <li>The application's algorithm used efficiently orders where almond loads should be dropped off to better manage loads and time.</li>
        <li>User can create assignments for workers to complete, and administrators can also override any changes made by the application.</li>
        <li>Administration can easily load and manage employees with access to the application through CSV-importable features.</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="speak">See the below video for a more in-depth look at our finalized application's features and appearance.</span>

      <i><h3 class="text">"Why would this be better than the current situation?"</h3></i>
      <span class="speak">The administration at the almond processing plant is not equipped with the tools to handle the various tasks that are required of the plant in an efficient manner. With random placement of the almonds on the plantâ€™s land and unorganized documentation, the plant uses more time, energy, and money than needed to run the day-to-day operations. When loads come into the processing plant, employees need to quickly categorize and place the loads in a time-effective manner to minimize waiting time and traffic for the drivers carrying the loads. Through this applications, employees will have a centralized way to access information about the grid and the almond loads at the plant to increase efficiency and save resources.</span>

      <i><h3 class="text">"What did you takeaway from this project?"</h3></i>
      <span class="speak">Through the development of this application, I learned how to work on a larger team of developers while utilizing technologies I was unfamiliar with to create an application that could actually have an effect on the real world. I grew and attained the tools and knowledge to be able to devleop a fully-functional application while handling the responsibilities of a leadership role within testing and frontend development. Overall, this application not only allowed myself to develop technical tools and techniques, but also provided experience in real-world development and sparked an interest of mine in mobile development.
